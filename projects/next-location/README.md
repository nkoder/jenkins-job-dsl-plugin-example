2. `sudo npm install -g bower` to install `bower` globally

3. `npm install --global gulp` to install `gulp` globally

4. `npm install` to install Node dependencies

5. `bower install` to install Bower dependencies

6. `gulp` to prepare project in `dist` folder and run server with it under [http://localhost:8000/index.html]()

## Deploy to Github Pages

From the directory of the project:

1. `gulp deploy:gh-pages`
     
2. Last command ends with strange error. A workaround is to force push.

        cd .publish
        git push --force origin gh-pages
        cd ..
        rm -rf .publish
